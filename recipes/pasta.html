<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This lemon asparagus and chicken pasta dish comes together quickly in just 30 minutes for an easy weeknight meal.</p>
  <p>The chicken and spaghetti get an extra boost of flavor from pesto sauce. My family loves this!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>½ (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
  <li>4 (5-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
  <li>¼ cup basil pesto, or to taste</li>
  <li>1 bunch asparagus, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
  <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
  <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
  <li>1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
  <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, reserving some pasta water.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>While pasta is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Flip, add a dollop of pesto to each chicken breast, and continue to cook, flipping as needed, until no longer pink in the centers, 7 to 10 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Heat remaining oil in a separate pan over medium heat. Add asparagus and cook for 1 to 3 minutes, depending how tender you like it. Add garlic, pepper flakes, and lemon juice; cook for 1 minute. Add cooked pasta, a dollop of pesto, and Parmesan cheese; stir until cheese melts. Add a tablespoon of the reserved pasta water if cheese begins to stick to the pan. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Chop chicken and add on top of spaghetti. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
