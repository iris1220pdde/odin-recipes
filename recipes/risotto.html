<p>This savory wild mushroom risotto uses dried chanterelles. </p>
<p>It's delicious topped with tangy Gorgonzola cheese.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 ounces dried chanterelle mushrooms</li> 
  <li>1 ½ teaspoons butter</li>
  <li> 1 teaspoon truffle oil (Optional)</li>
  <li>1 chopped onion</li>
  <li> 2 shallots, minced</li>
  <li> 1 clove garlic, minced</li>
  <li>3 ounces sliced fresh button mushrooms</li>
  <li>1 (12 ounce) package Arborio rice</li>
  <li> ½ cup dry white wine</li>
  <li>1 quart hot chicken stock</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
  <li> 2 tablespoons crumbled Gorgonzola cheese, or to taste</li>
  <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
</ul> 
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Cover chanterelle mushrooms with hot water, cover, and set aside to soften for 30 minutes. Once soft, remove mushrooms from water and chop; discard water.</p>
    </li>    
    <li>
        <p>Melt butter along with truffle oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion, shallot, and garlic; cook and stir two minutes until the onion begins to soften. Add fresh mushrooms; continue cooking until mushroom softens and begin to release their liquid. Stir in chopped chanterelle mushrooms, and cook 3 minutes more.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Add Arborio rice; cook and stir for a few minutes until rice looks glossy and is well coated with onion mixture. Stir in white wine and cook until nearly evaporated.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Reduce heat to medium; add 1/3 of the hot chicken stock. Cook and stir until chicken stock has been mostly absorbed, about 5 minutes. The risotto should be simmering gently while you stir in chicken stock. Add 1/2 of the remaining stock, and stir for 5 minutes more. Finally add remaining stock, and continue cooking until risotto is creamy and rice is tender, about 5 minutes more. The rice should not be completely soft, but still have a little firmness when you bite into it. You can add a little water if needed to cook the rice to this state.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Remove risotto from the heat, and stir in heavy cream and Gorgonzola cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve.</p>
